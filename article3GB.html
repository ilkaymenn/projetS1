    <h2>"Around the world, more than 62 million girls are not in school. But all it takes is one girl with courage to start a revolution."</h2>

    <h2>...addressing different barriers to accessing education.</h2>
        <p>Documentary by Richard E. Robbins, first released in the United States on March 7, 2013.</p>

    <h2>Bande d”annonce officiel !</h2>

    <h2>Message from Richard</h2>
        <p>First, to quote him; "I was surprised at how obvious this correlation was, and how much this reality had not penetrated the consciousness of a 
            certain audience" he said in a January 2013 interview with The Credits. <br><br>
            Thus, the documentary has three main objectives: <br><br>
        <ul>
            <li>the hope that one day mentalities will change,</li>
            <li>to show that giving women access to education in emerging countries could change the world, creating a new socio-economic momentum,</li>
            <li>to show the courage, the determination, the faith for a better future, for the access to education.</li><br><br>
        </ul>
        Moreover, fighting against girls' in-education would also help fight against poverty.</p>

    <h2>9 moving testimonials !</h2>
        <p>This documentary of more than an hour and a half, immerses us in the struggles of 9 young girls, each from a different origin, fighting to get an 
            education. <br><br>
            <ul>
                <li>Amina from Afghanistan,</li>
                <li>Senna from Peru,</li>
                <li>Mariama from Sierra Leone,</li>
                <li>Suma from Nepal,</li>
                <li>Sokha from Cambodia,</li>
                <li>Wadley from Haiti,</li>
                <li>Yasmin from Egypt,</li>
                <li>Azmera from Ethiopia,</li>
                <li>and finally Ruksana from India.</li>
            </ul>

        <p>I strongly invite you to visit the official Girl Rising website page, which gives more information about each girl.</p>  

    <h2>Right in the middle of countries...</h2>
        <p>These 9 girls have only thing in common; <br><br>
            <ul>
                <li>the fact that they are all from developing countries,</li>
                <li>and their lack of access to education.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

    <h2>...in development </h2>
        <p>Through this documentary we will follow the different obstacles that these 9 girls have faced, blocking them from their education. <br><br>
            Whether it be : <br><br>
            <ul>
                <li>early marriages and early pregnancies,</li>
                <li>sex trafficking,</li>
                <li>discrimination between the sexes,</li>            
                <li>slavery,</li>
                <li>or poverty</li>
            </ul>
            this documentary will show us the differences of life in developing countries. 
        </p>

    <h2>BUT, ''Without falling into miserabilism''</h2>
        <p> Indeed, we will also find paths that have had their positive turning points. Notably with that of Sokha. A young Cambodian girl who goes from life in 
            the garbage dumps to the life of a child star entering college. <br><br>
            Or Suma's, who after 6 years away from her family as a servant, is finally freed to go back to school.
        </p>
