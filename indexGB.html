    <h2>Did you know that letting girls go to school can help curb poverty ?</h2>
        <p>Feminism is a word that is very often used and often taken up in a rather pejorative connotation. It is important to give a real meaning to this term, which has been tarnished by the media and their way of conceiving information. <br><br>
            Many inequalities are too often ignored when they should be the very basis of the fight for gender equality. <br><br>
            One such cause that is long overdue is the lack of education for girls around the world. </p>

        <p>This is precisely what our project is about, which aims to produce a mobile information site for everyone around the theme of women, education and girls. <br><br>
            Our site will stand out from the rest, especially because it will be ahead of the news. The news will be updated frequently to keep the information as close to you as possible. So, whether you are an activist or just looking for information, you will be transported into the real world of feminism.
